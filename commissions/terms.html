                <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE!</h1>
                <p>Thank you for your interest in my commissions! Before proceeding, please take a moment to read and understand the terms below. By commissioning me, you agree to all of these terms and conditions.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">General Terms</h2>
                <ul style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0;">
                    <li>To ensure that your commission meets your expectations, please provide clear and detailed references when you make your request. References can include images, written descriptions, or other forms of media.</li>
                    <li>I reserve the right to deny any commission request for any reason. Reasons for denying a request may include, but are not limited to: inappropriate content, lack of references, inability to complete the request, or other reasons at my discretion.</li>
                    <li>I may work on commissions on stream, but this is not a guarantee. If you have concerns about your commission being streamed, please let me know and we can discuss alternative arrangements.</li>
                    <li>I do not create artwork for the purpose of being sold as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). If you are interested in a commission for this purpose, please note that I do not offer this service and will not provide the necessary files for creating NFTs.</li>
                    <li>Please do not put my art through an AI or other machine learning programs without my permission, as this can damage the quality and integrity of the artwork. If you would like to use my artwork in any way not covered by the License and Copyright section, please contact me to discuss.</li>
                </ul> 

                <h2 style="margin: 0;">Payment</h2>
                <ul style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0;">
                    <li>Commissions must be paid in US dollars (USD) through PayPal. If you are unable to use PayPal, please contact me to discuss alternative payment methods.</li>
                    <li>Payment can be made in one lump sum or in installments based on the agreed-upon price. If paying in installments, a non-refundable deposit of at least 50% of the total price is required upfront. The remaining balance must be paid in full before the final commission is delivered.</li>
                    <li>If you are paying in installments, you must adhere to the agreed-upon payment schedule. Failure to make a payment within 7 days of the due date will result in the commission being put on hold until payment is received. If payment is not received within 30 days of the due date, the commission will be canceled and no refund will be issued.</li>
                    <li>Prices are subject to change and may vary based on the complexity of the commission. If the price changes, clients who have already booked a commission will not be affected by the change unless there is a significant change in the scope of work.</li>
                    <li>Refunds or cancellations are not available once I begin the digital phase of your commission, as this is when I start investing significant time and effort into your artwork. If you need to cancel your commission before the digital phase, please contact me as soon as possible to discuss a refund.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 style="margin: 0;">Timeline</h2>
                <ul style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0;">
                    <li>All still images will come with a transparent and a single tone background PNG.</li>
                    <li>The timeline for completing a commission varies depending on the complexity and scope of the request. I will provide an estimated timeline when we discuss the commission details. Please note that this timeline is an estimate and may change based on my workload and other factors.</li>
                    <li>Work on a Vtuber model is multifaceted and complex, and can take months from the first payment for a completed commission. The exact timeline will depend on the complexity of the model and the number of revisions required.</li>
                    <li>I will provide regular updates on the progress of your commission and will reach out to you if I have any questions or concerns. If I do not receive a response from you within 3 days of my message, I will assume that you are satisfied with the current state of the commission and will continue working on it.</li>
                    <li>If you have a specific deadline for your commission, please let me know as soon as possible so that I can adjust my schedule and prioritize your request. Additional fees may apply for rush orders or expedited work.</li>
                </ul> 

                <h2 style="margin: 0;">License and Copyright</h2>

                    <li>You are not allowed to resell, reproduce, distribute, or claim the artwork as your own creation. If you would like to use the artwork for any commercial purposes outside of the agreed-upon commission, please contact me to discuss licensing options and fees.</li>
                    <li>If you would like to post the artwork on social media or other platforms, you must credit me as the artist and provide a link to my website, chupivt.art.</li>
